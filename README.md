# Deep Learning Image Classifier

This repository contains code for building a deep learning image classifier using TensorFlow. The classifier is trained to classify images into two classes: "Happy" and "Sad".

## Overview

The image classifier is built using deep learning techniques and TensorFlow framework. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn features from input images and make predictions about their classes.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Organize your dataset into separate directories for each class.
   - Ensure images are in supported formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

3. **Training**:
   - Run the training script to train the image classifier on your dataset.
   - Adjust hyperparameters and network architecture as needed.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset to assess its performance.
   - Compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Inference**:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
   - Ensure preprocessing steps are applied to input images before inference.

6. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model in your desired environment for real-world use cases.
   - Consider optimization techniques for efficient inference.
